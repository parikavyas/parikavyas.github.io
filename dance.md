Currently, I am a Data Science Associate Consultant at ZS Associates where I have been on a remarkable journey through the dynamic landscape of data science and artificial intelligence. In the last 3.5 years, I have witnessed and fallen in love with the magic created when data science meets the art of marketing. I have worked with clients across diverse sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry, consumer goods, and software while building my proficiency to harness the power of AI to unlock marketingâ€™s potential. 
I believe sharing acquired knowledge is as important as learning. So, please join me as I unravel the intricacies of data science and marketing, and dive deeper into the transformative power of data in the business world while offering a glimpse into my tiny time on this massive stage of the world.
